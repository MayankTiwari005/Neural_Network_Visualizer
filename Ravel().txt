Converts 2d planner used for plotting to 1d vectors for predictions, as machine can predict on the basis of points not on plot

Your training data X is 2D (each point = [x, y])
Example:

X = [[1, 10],
     [2, 10],
     [1, 20],
     [2, 20]]

This is what your model trains on.

Step 1: You want to visualize the model‚Äôs decision regions

That means you need to cover every possible (x, y) in the plot area ‚Äî
like painting the entire plane, not just 4 points.

So you first create ranges of possible x and y values:

x_vals = np.linspace(x_min, x_max)
y_vals = np.linspace(y_min, y_max)


Both of these are 1D arrays, e.g.

x_vals = [1, 2, 3, 4, ...]
y_vals = [10, 20, 30, 40, ...]

-----------------------------------------------------------
Step 2: You need to make a 2D grid of all coordinate pairs

That‚Äôs where:

X_plane, Y_plane = np.meshgrid(x_vals, y_vals)

Every combination of x and y to cover the entire plane:

(1,10), (2,10), (3,10) ...
(1,20), (2,20), (3,20) ...
...


That is a 2D structure, which represents the layout of the plane.

Now you can plot it: But your model can‚Äôt predict on it yet ‚Äî because the classifier expects list of points, not 2D matrices.

Step 3: You ‚Äúflatten‚Äù the grid to send it to the model

The model expects:

[[x1, y1],
 [x2, y2],
 [x3, y3],
  ...]


So, must flatten those grids (2D to 1D):

X_plane.ravel() ‚Üí [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, ...]
Y_plane.ravel() ‚Üí [10, 10, 10, 20, 20, 20, ...]


Then combine them:

grid_points = np.column_stack((X_plane.ravel(), Y_plane.ravel()))


Now you have a list of all coordinates:

[[1,10], [2,10], [3,10],
 [1,20], [2,20], [3,20], ...]


This is fine for prediction (clf.predict()).

Step 5: After prediction, reshape back to 2D for visualization

The predictions Z come back as a long 1D list (one value per point).
To plot the colored regions, you need to put them back into the grid form matching X_plane shape.

So you do:

Z = Z.reshape(X_plane.shape)


Now you can color each region on the plot.

‚öôÔ∏è So in short:
Stage	Data Shape	Purpose
x_vals, y_vals	1D	just ranges of values
meshgrid() ‚Üí X_plane, Y_plane	2D	creates coordinate grid for plotting
.ravel() + column_stack()	1D ‚Üí 2D (list of points)	prepare input for predict()
reshape()	back to 2D	plot the predicted surface
