# Neural_Network_Visualizer
shows MLP decision boundary interactively (Multilayer perceptron classifier)
MLP Interactive Classifier

This project demonstrates how the complexity of a neural network (controlled by the number of neurons in the hidden layer) influences the decision boundaries during classification.

#Overview

The notebook uses an interactive slider to visualize the effect of changing hidden layer size in a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier. It provides a clear, real-time understanding of how neural networks learn nonlinear decision boundaries.

#Features

-Adjustable hidden layer size (1–5 neurons)
-Dynamic visualization of decision boundaries
-Implementation using scikit-learn, matplotlib, and ipywidgets

#Dataset

The dataset is generated using make_circles() — a two-dimensional, non-linearly separable dataset commonly used for testing classification algorithms.

#Usage

-Open the notebook in Google colab or Jupyter Notebook and run all cells.
-The interactive slider will allow you to adjust the hidden layer size and observe how the model adapts its boundary.

#Requirements

Python 3.x
scikit-learn
matplotlib
ipywidgets
numpy
AI fundamentals
